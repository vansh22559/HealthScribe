Prediction: For information purposes, synchrony of menstruation is observed among mothers, sisters, and daughters who live together, and sometimes among women who work together. A study of 135 women in a women's college dorm revealed that most of the cycle shifting occurred within the first four months and typically occurred after seven months. The phenomenon is attributed to the release of hormones, and when multiple women in a house experience periods, their bodies coordinate their release, making all three human bodies more efficient.

Prediction: For information purposes, hypothyroidism, characterized by a deficiency in thyroid hormones, can lead to weight gain and a lack of energy. It's essential to maintain a healthy metabolism as we age to prevent weight gain and associated complications or dieases. Maintaining a balanced diet and incorporating regular exercise is crucial for overall well-being. Consuming a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and water is recommended for optimal health.

Prediction: For information purposes, the treatment for sciatica involves various approaches. Manual interventions, including physical therapy and specific stretching and strengthening exercises, and osteopathic manipulation, aim to alleviate pressure on the nerve root, which is the cause of the pain. Medical treatments include medications like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral steroids, or epidural steroid injections to relieve inflammation, often a component of the pain. Surgical options include microdiscectomy or lumbar laminectomy and discectomy to remove the portion of the disc that is irritating the nerve root. X-rays can provide insights into the cause of sciatica, and chiropractors and massage therapists can offer therapeutic exercises and guidance on lifestyle changes such as sleeping postion, footwear, posture, etc.

Sample {'uri': '3383175', 'question': 'Can drinking to many diet cokes cause an ulcer?', 'context': 'I drink about 8 a day', 'answers': ['It sure can - read this... it tells you what else can cause ulcers and explains what an ulcer is.  My uncle had to stop soda altogether because of this (good luck!):\n\nAn ulcer is an open wound that develops in the tissue of a digestive tract. \n\nThere are two main types of ulcers- \n\nPeptic or gastric ulcers, they form in the stomach. The gastric juice that is produced in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, mucus, and an enzyme called pepsin. Sometimes, the mixture of pepsin and acids acts on the wall of the digestive tract and the result is a peptic ulcer. \n\nDuodenal ulcer forms in the small intestines near the stomach. They are more common than gastric ulcers. \n\nHow do you know if you have an ulcer? Pain! The pain may occur from 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pain rarely comes in the morning, but usually follows after lunch and dinner. And it may occur after midnight. \n\nIntense burning pain occurs in the area of the lower chest and/or upper abdomen. Additional symptoms that may be experienced are weight loss, a decrease in appetite, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. \n\nThere may be times when the pain of an ulcer seems to be gone and then it suddenly returns. Pain associated with ulcers affect different people in different ways. \n\nThere are different causes for the formation of ulcers. In some cases the bacterium "H. pylori" is responsible for the majority of ulcers. It says that too much stomach acid aggravates the already existing problem. People who develop ulcers usually have a higher concentration of hydrochloric acid than is normal. \n\nSome medications are known to cause ulcers such as those used to relieve the swelling of arthritis. Aditionally care should be taken when using ibuprofen and aspirin since they can cause irritation and bleeding. \n\nTense, ambitious, hard-driving people are more likely to develop ulcers than calm people. Other causes are alcoholic beverages, caffeine, stress, and smoking. Drinks that often contain caffeine are soda, tea, and coffee. Chocolate also contains caffeine and should be avoided. "The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide" adds that the elderly are more susceptible to developing a stomach ulcer. People who do not eat regular meals or who are rushed during mealtime are also likely candidates for this type of ulcer. \n\nAlthough uncers can bleed, bleeding due to a stomach ulcer is rare, but it can be very serious. An ulcer that bleeds slowly over a period of time, may eventually lead to anemia, weight loss, decrease in appetite, and infection. A more serious complication of a persistent gastric ulcer is stomach cancer. \n\n\n\nWhen a duodenal ulcer goes untreated, the risks are low. However, bleeding from duodenal ulcers can cause anemia. Heavy bleeding from this type of ulcer may cause nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. Scarring from a duodenal ulcer can also cause a dangerous blockage. \n\nIf you find the above mentioned symptoms, contact the doctor. Immediate medical attention should be given if the patient is vomiting blood, has cold skin accompanied by sweating, faintness, weakness, or is experiencing extreme pain. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for prompt healing and also to prevent the ulcer from coming back. \n\nThe above is provided for your information, but you are responsible for your own actions to deal with your ulcers or gastro esophageal health problems.  Our information is not medical advice.  You must see your own doctor for medical advice about your gastro esophageal or ulcers.', 'I don\'t know...but 8 is TOO MUCH.\n\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet is not very sweet in itself, that may be why Equal puts Dextrose (sugar) and maltodextrin as the first ingredients, so that it tastes sweet.\n\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet is a brain drug that stimulates your brain so you think that the food you\'re eating tastes sweet.

Prediction: For information purposes, staying well-hydrated not only helps maintain proper hydration levels but also plays a crucial role in maintaining overall bodily functions. The body relies on water for essential fluid support, and electrolytes, found in blood, other fluids, and cells, are essential for proper functioning. While the body may lose fluids in various ways, such as when vomiting or sweating from the lungs during normal breathing, severe dehydration can lead to dry-up or dehydration, potentially resulting in death. Adequate hydration not only helps maintain proper fluid balance but also plays a crucial role in maintaining overall bodily functions.
