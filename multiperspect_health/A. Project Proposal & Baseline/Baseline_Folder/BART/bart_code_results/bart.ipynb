Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurologic disorders of the elderly. The term \"parkinsonism\" refers to any condition that causes any combination of the types of movement abnormalities seen in Parkinson's disease by damaging or destroying dopamine neurons in a certain area of the brain. Parkinsonism describes the common symptoms of Parkinson's disease - tremor, rigidity, akinesia or bradykinesia and postural instability. Those patients who respond to drug treatment for Parkinson's disease are diagnosed with it, and those who do not have parkinsonism. Associated question: what is parkinesonism? \n",
      "Summary: Parkinson's disease is a prevalent neurologic disorder among the elderly. The term \"parkinsonism\" encompasses any condition leading to movement abnormalities similar to those observed in Parkinson's disease. This condition arises from the damage or destruction of dopamine neurons in a specific brain region. Common symptoms of parkinsonism include tremors, rigidity, akinesia or bradykinesia, and postural instability. Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is established in patients responding to drug treatments, while those who do not respond are categorized under parkinsonism.\n",

      "Summary: It is suggested to use duct tape to record yourself, and then review the tape with your husband to assess if seeking advice from a psychiatrist is necessary. If you find difficulty sleeping, consider various strategies such as managing stress, ensuring tiredness before sleep, reading, drinking warm milk, exercising, and attempting to resolve dream conflicts. Seeking professional guidance for sleeping issues, including the possibility of taking sleeping tablets or magnesium supplements, may be beneficial. Additionally, it is recommended to avoid violent TV programs before bedtime, address irritations from the day, manage heavy workloads, and pray before sleep as part of a holistic approach to improving sleep quality.\n",
